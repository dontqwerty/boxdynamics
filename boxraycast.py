        proceeds by returning a float that indicates the fractional length of
        the ray. By returning 0, you set the ray length to zero. By returning
        the current fraction, you proceed to find the closest point. By
        returning 1, you continue with the original ray clipping. By returning
        -1, you will filter out the current fixture (the ray will not hit it).
